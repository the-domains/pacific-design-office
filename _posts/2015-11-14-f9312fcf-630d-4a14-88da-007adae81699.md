Medicare Australia provides a rebate for many medical consultation items, as a taxpayer-funded contribution towards the cost of your healthcare. Most Australian citizens and permanent residents qualify for this rebate, as well as visiting citizens from countries that have a reciprocal healthcare agreement with Australia. 

In order to claim your rebate, you must bring your current Medicare card and your EFTPOS/debit card with you to the practice. We can approve the rebate for most consultation items on the spot, via our HICAPS terminal. The Medicare rebate is then deposited immediately into your cheque or savings account. 

Some items and combinations of items are not able to be claimed via our HICAPS terminal, as they need to be verified by a Medicare agent prior to payment. In these cases, you will need to: 

visit a Medicare office, 

or complete a mail-in Medicare claim form, 

or submit your own claim online via [www.my.gov.au ][0]
